# TicTacToe
最近作出了一個井字棋遊戲的程式，設計上，就是會有一個判斷是否勝利的函式，跟棋子是否可以放在這裡的函式，還有電腦下棋的程式(電腦會判斷後下棋)。控制上不是用滑鼠點擊，而是用數字鍵去點選，例：按７會在最左上角放入棋子，按３會在最右下角放入棋子，以此類推。
最後還差點沒存檔，如果沒有我應該會哭哭吧 (幸好有存)
以下是我的程式，請小心服用。

Recently I made a program for a tic-tac-toe game. There is a function to determine if the game is won or not, a function to determine if the piece can be placed here, and a function for the computer to make a move (the computer will determine and then make the move). 
Instead of clicking with the mouse, you use the numeric keys to click, e.g. pressing 7 will put a piece in the top left corner, pressing 3 will put a piece in the bottom right corner, and so on.
I almost didn't save the program. I would have cried if I didn't (luckily I did).
Here is my program. Enjoy!
